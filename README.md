# Topics detection

Identify key topics in your texts

# Based on the new version of Cowo

Cowo turns a text into a network. I have [updated it recently](https://github.com/seinecle/cowo-function) to make it more readable and easier to maintain.

"Topics detection" applies a Louvain algo on the network created by Cowo, and returns the most frequent terms in each community identified.

# What's new

Topics detection is meant to be called via an API. It is implemented in [Nocode Functions](https://nocodefunctions.com).

The code base has been made cleaner.
